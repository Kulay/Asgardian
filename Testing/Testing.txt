Since Language will not have set words or roots until after the design of its grammar and  alphabet,
testing will be restricted to either dummy words, or simplified English word-chunks.

For example -- a sentence made using simple English word-chunks would look something like this:

	You(subj) now-off-table-remove(verb) you-dog(obj)

This means: Get your dog off the table.

Of course, this is only an approximate example, and may not represent what Language's actual sentence
structure will look like.
