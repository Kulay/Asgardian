// These are mostly some ideas about what Language's sentence structure will look like.
// Right now, these are mostly a jumble of ideas, but will find some form of categorization in the future.

Nouns in Language will have the ability to be used as verbs -- that is, instead of saying "I am driving to
work", one could theoretically say, "I am car-ing to work", in which the verb most closely associated with
the object is the presumed verb. This is is an interesting feature, and while I feel this may introduce
some ambiguity and strange cases at times, this may prove useful in the end.

Language will have a flexible syntax, as each word should be able to signify its place in the sentence
through inflection.
