**Q: What will Asgardian be based on?**

A: Asgardian will not be based on any particular language. The grammar rules will be inspired by taking the useful aspects of many languages. For words, there are several ways we can do this:

1. Use words inspired from a single language (such as Latin). I really don't like this idea, as it would make learning words easier for some native speakers than others, but this would be the easiest to implement.

2. Use words taken from multiple languages. The idea would be to use words taken from their earliest etymologies and put them together in Asgardian. This would honestly take the most effort, and yet it may not even be worth it, as it would be a very messy process and the language may sound very inconsistent in the end. However, it would make learning the language equally as easy or difficult for everyone, though the same benefit would come from the 3rd possible method.

3. Create new and unique words. I think this would be the best method. It would more likely prevent miscommunications and prevent certain people from having an advantage of learning the language from the others. It would also allow us superior control in the way that words are morphologically created and structured.

**Q: Why not use Esperanto?**

A: Esperanto is very Euro-centric. The words and many of its grammar rules were inspired by just 3 languages! French, German, and English. This makes it much easier to learn by speakers of western languages. In addition, it was made a long time ago and some modern Ideas that I would like to have in Asgardian, cannot be in Esperanto because it cannot be changed. However, some ideas and rules may inspire Asgardian, as will rules of many other languages.

**Q: Why not use English? Many people speak it and it's Lingua Franca on the Internet.**

A: English is a very difficult language and has many inconsistencies. The spelling is not very phonetic, and there are different dialects, as well as two versions (UK and USA). Also, it would be unfair for speakers of English to have a communicative advantage over others whose first language wasn't English.
