Asgardian
========

Asgardian is an Auxilliary Language -- not a conlang -- designed to be powerful, flexible, resiliant, and useful.

Summary
-------

It is my hope that I, and potentially others, can create a language that is logical and elegant, yet will feel natural to use, and will be useful for those that wish to communicate with others in a manner easier than learning another human's native tongue.  

Asgardian is meant to be useful, though not necessarily easy. Efficiency is preferred, even if sometimes sacrificing simplicity, though complexity is not the aim, either.

Asgardian is planned to contain features that are seen in many languages, allowing users of Language to be as flexible as possible with the way they express and share their ideas. This will also allow native speakers of various languages to find familiarity in Asgardian, and utilize its flexibility in a way that feels as natural as their own native tongue.

Despite its potential feature creep, Asgardian will be designed with the idea that what doesn't need to be said, shouldn't be said. Ideas that are commonly expressed in some languages, and are often viewed as relevant by a culture that uses said language, may not have the same level of relevance in another. For example: in English, it is common (and usually expected) for one to specify the sex, or gender, of an individual when speaking of them. In spoken Chinese, it is not very common to specify the sex, or gender, unless it is necessary. Asgardian will not have gendered pronouns, and will not require it unless the speaker provides excess information. This is, of course, not the only example, but it should give potential contributors an idea of how Asgardian is intended to function.

Asgardian will also feature something I call "defaults", in which any parts of a sentence not explicitly defined will default to a common value, such that a sentence may be as short as a single word, and will still yet be considered a full sentence and also grammatically coherent.

Project Management
------------------

The general direction of Asgardian will be recommended by me, Christian, but Asgardian will be made by the people, for the people, by a selected committee.

If you wish to join the committee, please contact me, Christian, via Discord @ ChristianTheSatanist#4885 :)

Current members of the committee are:

Christian Winslett (Project Lead), DISCORD: ChristianTheSatanist#4885

Sonja, DISCORD: Lilyanatos#1051

Status
------

Asgardian is currently in its beginning stages -- right now, only an alphabet and a few grammar rules are made, and both are still subject to change. There are some milestones to reach before Asgardian can be a fully-featured and usable means of human communication.

All current rules of the language are subject to change via committee vote at any time before the final draft for Asgardian is made.

ASgardian will use 3-point version system similar to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), with the exception that a YYYYMM number will be used instead of a patch number, and will increment the first of every month.

The steps to be completed before 1.0.* can be reached are as follows:

* 0.1.*: Create a robust and powerful grammar system that will allow for the recycling and combining of existing root words to create new words

* 0.2.*: Choose or design a semi-phonetic alphabet/script that will to be used for Language

* 0.3.*: Determine how root words will be generated for language, implement the words in a manner that fits naturally with the robust grammar system, and create the first edition dictionary containing, at the least, the most common of words necessary for the average human to effectively communicate with others

Once the 0.3.* series is completed, a 1.0.* will be announced, Language will be fully-featured, and will likely have a new, more permanent, name.

After 1.0.*, work will mostly consist of expanding the dictionary to specialty areas, particularly subjects such as scientific naming conventions.

Asgardian will become the best that it can be through the friendly collaboration of others, and if you feel so inclined to do so, check out the [contributing](https://github.com/drakovyrn/Language/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page to find out how you can get started.

License
-------

It is my firm belief that, as a form of expression, languages are property of the public, not to be owned by any one person or entity, not even myself. As such, Language will always be free for all people to use, under the [CC0 1.0](https://github.com/drakovyrn/Language/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
