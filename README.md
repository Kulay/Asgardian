Asgardian
========

Asgardian is an Auxilliary Language designed to be powerful, flexible, logical, and useful.

Summary
-------

It is my hope that I, and potentially others, can create a language that is logical and elegant, will feel natural to use, and will be useful for those that wish to communicate with others in a manner easier than learning another human's native tongue.  
Asgardian is planned to contain features that are seen in many languages, allowing users of Language to be as flexible as possible with the way they express and share their ideas. This will also allow native speakers of various languages to find familiarity in Asgardian, and utilize its flexibility in a way that feels as natural as their own native tongue.

Project Management
------------------

The general direction of Asgardian will be recommended by me, Christian, but Asgardian will be made by the people, for the people, by a selected committee.

If you wish to join the committee, please contact me, Christian, via Discord @ ChristianTheSatanist#4885

Current members of the committee are:

Christian Winslett (Project Lead), DISCORD: ChristianTheSatanist#4885

Sonja, DISCORD: Lilyanatos#1051

Serena, DISCORD: Serendipity#4597

Nimueh, DISCORD: Nimueh#7013

Michele Sama, DISCORD: -RAX-#7779

Status
------

Asgardian is currently in its beginning and testing stages -- right now, only a few grammar rules exist, and those are subject to change. There are some milestones to reach before Asgardian can be a fully-featured and usable means of human communication.

Contributing
------------

Asgardian will become the best that it can be through the friendly collaboration of others, and if you feel so inclined to do so, check out the [contributing](https://github.com/drakovyrn/Language/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page to find out how you can get started.

License
-------

It is my firm belief that, as a form of expression, languages are property of the public, not to be owned by any one person or entity, not even myself. As such, Language will always be free for all people to use, under the [CC0 1.0](https://github.com/drakovyrn/Language/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
